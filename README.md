# oop-core README

This application serves the management API for the Open Interop platform. Individual micro-services consume authentication details, temprs, and device configuration via this application.

The application is tenanted and multiple accounts can be setup and configured on a single instance.

The application will run in isolation and can be configured before setting up the micro-service architecture. However, certain elements will not work. For example, previewing temprs.

The application is API only. If you would like to run the interface see the [interface repository](https://github.com/open-interop/oop-core-interface).

## Installation

The application has been developed against Ruby 2.6.3 and PostgreSQL 10

- Clone the application `git clone git@github.com:open-interop/oop-core.git`
- In the app directory install dependencies `bundle install`
- Ensure your database details are setup in `config/database.yml`
- Create the database `bundle exec rails db:create`
- Run the database migrations `bundle exec rails db:migrate`

In order to communicate with the micro-service back-end we use RabbitMQ. Connection to this and the relevant queues is defined in the environment. In development you can define these in `.env` using the `dotenv-rails` gem.

### Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables.
